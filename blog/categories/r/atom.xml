    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a coworker has been sharing some higher-order shell
functions he has been writing, inspired by the first of these
articles:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Higher-order-function-in-zsh">Higher Order Functions in Zsh</a></li>
<li><a href="http://conway.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/wiki/blog/posts/Higher-order_shell/">Higher-order shell</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Both discuss small scripts and shell functions that allow you to more
easily compose simple unix tools to complete complex task.</p>

<p>My own <code>~/bin</code> contains similar higher-order functions and other
simple tools.  Like most unix tools, they do a single task and are
composable with other tools on the command line.  However, I am often
surprised by the number of heavy command-line users I see who don&rsquo;t
regularly encapsulate repetitive tasks or constructions into shell
functions or aliases.</p>

<p>In my experience, the majority of such tools</p>

<ul>
<li>take less than 5 minutes to write,</li>
<li>require almost no maintenance, and</li>
<li>prove repeatably useful after their initial creation.</li>
</ul>


<p>This post shares two tools in my <code>~/bin</code> that I used this weekend.  I
created both while ago for entirely different purposes, but was still
able to easily use them together without modification.</p>

<h2>do.times N COMMAND</h2>

<p><code>do.times</code> executes COMMAND, N times.  For example,</p>

<p><code>
$ do.times 5 echo hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
</code></p>

<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/2014470">tool itself</a> is little more than
a wrapper to a shell <code>for</code> loop, but the typing it saves and the
semantic value it provides when constructing a command line has proven
valuable on numerous occasions.</p>

<h2>summarize [OPTIONS] [FILE]</h2>

<p><code>summarize</code> reads columns of data from either a file given as an
argument or its standard input and provides basic summary statistics.
I originally wrote this to do quick spot checks of data files I was
working on before sending them off to collaborators.</p>

<p>Here is an example of its output:
```
$ summarize &mdash;sep=&ldquo;,&rdquo; &mdash;header data_file</p>

<pre><code>wombats            frogs
</code></pre>

<p> Min.   :0.01911   Min.   :0.02979
 1st Qu.:0.22101   1st Qu.:0.32504
 Median :0.51178   Median :0.50530
 Mean   :0.51318   Mean   :0.51650
 3rd Qu.:0.79354   3rd Qu.:0.71484
 Max.   :0.99561   Max.   :0.99827
 It requires
Covariance Matrix:</p>

<pre><code>        wombats       frogs
</code></pre>

<p>wombats 0.084647845 0.006553818
frogs   0.006553818 0.074872790</p>

<p>Column Sums:
 wombats    frogs
51.31770 51.65021</p>

<p>Number of Rows:
[1] 100</p>

<p>First 6 Rows:</p>

<pre><code> wombats     frogs
</code></pre>

<p>1 0.15767016 0.3545217
2 0.42022851 0.5092576
3 0.22144630 0.6796292
4 0.84320607 0.6749124
5 0.07491303 0.3430995
6 0.65910419 0.3053271
```</p>

<p>While it doesn&rsquo;t seem like much, these basic statistics are often all
one needs to ensure they are sending the correct data to a teammate or
to quickly answer a basic question.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/2014462">summarize</a> uses Rscript, an
executable shipped with R that allows one to create scripts using R.
Recently, I added a dependency on the CRAN package <code>optparse</code> to make
handling options a bit more straightforward.  With the exception of
the option parsing, the R code itself is likely easily understood by
anyone who has used R.</p>

<h1>Smoke Testing Speed Improvements</h1>

<p>This weekend I have been working on a small set of improvements to
make some not-so-simple tools I use on a regular basis a bit
faster. Combining <code>do.times</code> and <code>summarize</code> allowed me to quickly
generate a smoke test for whether the speed improvements I was
implementing were working.  To protect the innocent, I&rsquo;ll use <code>git
--version</code> as an example of the command I wanted to test:</p>

<p>```
$ do.times 100 time git &mdash;version 2>&amp;1 | awk &lsquo;/real/ {print substr($2,3,5)}&rsquo; | summarize</p>

<pre><code>   V1
</code></pre>

<p> Min.   :0.00100
 1st Qu.:0.00100
 Median :0.00100
 Mean   :0.00116
 3rd Qu.:0.00100
 Max.   :0.00400</p>

<p>Covariance Matrix:</p>

<pre><code>         V1
</code></pre>

<p>V1 2.771717e-07</p>

<p>Column Sums:
   V1
0.116</p>

<p>Number of Rows:
[1] 100</p>

<p>First 6 Rows:</p>

<pre><code> V1
</code></pre>

<p>1 0.004
2 0.004
3 0.001
4 0.002
5 0.001
6 0.001
```</p>

<p>While this isn&rsquo;t scientific testing by any means, it was enough to
keep me moving in the right direction, and simple enough that the cost
of creating and running the test was practically zero.</p>

    <link href="http://stevendanna.github.com/blog/2012/01/01/r-ohai-plugin/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-01T15:44:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://stevendanna.github.com/blog/2012/01/01/r-ohai-plugin</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/opscode/ohai">Ohai</a> is a library used by Chef to collect information about nodes
within your infrastructure.  Information is collected by a set of Ohai
plugins, most of which parse the output of system commands.</p>

<p>During lunch on Friday, I create a simple Ohai plugin to collect some basic
information about R. You can find the plugin here:</p>

<p>  <a href="https://github.com/stevendanna/ohai-plugins/blob/master/r.rb">https://github.com/stevendanna/ohai-plugins/blob/master/r.rb</a></p>

<p>Currently, this plugin collects:</p>

<ul>
<li>The version of R,</li>
<li>The installed packages, and</li>
<li>The output of <code>capabilities()</code></li>
</ul>


<p>To use this plugin right away, the easiest course of action is to use
the <a href="http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/ohai">Opscode Ohai cookbook</a>.  From your chef repository:</p>

<p>``` bash
knife cookbook site install ohai
wget <a href="https://raw.github.com/stevendanna/ohai-plugins/master/r.rb">https://raw.github.com/stevendanna/ohai-plugins/master/r.rb</a>
mv r.rb cookbooks/ohai/files/default/plugins/
knife cookbook upload ohai</p>

<h1>Add the recipe to the run list of the relevant nodes</h1>

<h1>or roles</h1>

<p>knife node run_list add NODENAME ohai</p>

<h1>The ohai plugin will run on the next chef-client run</h1>

<p>knife ssh &lsquo;name:NODENAME&rsquo;
```</p>

<p>In order to avoid unnecessary runs of Ohai within a chef-client run
you can add the following line to the <code>client.rb</code> configuration file on your nodes:</p>

<p><code>ruby
Ohai::Config[:plugin_path] &lt;&lt; '/etc/chef/ohai_plugins'
</code></p>

<p>If you are using Opscode&rsquo;s chef-client cookbook, this will already be
taken care of for you.</p>

<p>The following is an example of the information it collects:</p>

<p>```</p>

<blockquote><p>knife node show snow-master -a languages.r -Fj
{
  &ldquo;languages.r&rdquo;: {</p>

<pre><code>"capabilities": {
  "tiff": true,

  },
  {

  },
</code></pre>

<p>[ &hellip; SNIP MANY MORE PACKAGE &hellip;]</p>

    "version": "2.14.1",
    "built": "2.14.1"
  }
],
"version": "2.14.1"
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}</p></blockquote>

    <link href="http://stevendanna.github.com/blog/2011/12/26/snow-and-chef/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-26T09:32:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://stevendanna.github.com/blog/2011/12/26/snow-and-chef</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my major interests is programming in R.  I took a few days off
for Christmas break, and in between talking with family, watching old
movies, opening presents, and spreading Christmas cheer, I decided it
would be fun to use Chef to create a parallel computing environment
suitable for use with R.  As part of this project, I wrote:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Chef cookbook to install and configure R.</li>
<li>An R package provider to easily install packages from CRAN.</li>
<li>A Chef cookbook to install and configure MPI.</li>
</ul>


<p>This blog post outlines some of the highlights of this fun little
project. It isn&rsquo;t a step-by-step tutorial for creating such
an environment.  I assume that already have:</p>

<ul>
<li>General familiarity with R and Chef.  I talk about cookbooks,
recipes, and roles and assume you know what to do with them.</li>
<li>A means of provisioning computation nodes, each already configured
with hostnames that are resolvable to network addresses by other
computation nodes.</li>
</ul>


<p>I used vagrant to provision a few VMs for testing these recipes and a
small set of vagrant-specific cookbooks to ensure that each node had a
resolvable hostname.</p>

<h1>R Cookbook</h1>

<p>The first item every node in the cluster will need is R.  The R
cookbook on the Opscode Community site is a bit out of date.  I&rsquo;ve
created a newer version that can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/stevendanna/cookbook-r">http://github.com/stevendanna/cookbook-r</a></p>

<p>This cookbook does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installs R from either the CRAN APT repository or from source depending
on the platform.</li>
<li>Defines a system-wide default CRAN mirror using an Rprofile.site
template.</li>
<li>Contains an R package provider that can install R packages available
on CRAN.</li>
</ul>


<p>Currently this cookbook is linux-centric and best suited for use on
Ubuntu or Debian.</p>

<h2>R Package Provider</h2>

<p>My R parallel computing environment relies on the &lsquo;snow&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rmpi&rsquo;
packages to manage communication with computation nodes.  Further, I
often need additional packages from CRAN when working with my cluster.
The R package provider in my R cookbook allows for easy, automated
installation of R packages.  It was written using Chef&rsquo;s Light-weight
Resource and Provider DSL.  The current version provides the minimal
necessary functionality:</p>

<p>``` ruby &ldquo;R package provider.  Corresponding resource description not shown.&rdquo;
action :install do
  execute &ldquo;Install R Package&rdquo; do</p>

<pre><code>command r_package_install(new_resource.package)
not_if r_package_is_installed(new_resource.package)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>action :upgrade do
  execute &ldquo;Upgrade R Package&rdquo; do</p>

<pre><code>command r_package_install(new_resource.package)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>action :remove do
  r_package_remove = &ldquo;remove.packages(&lsquo;#{new_resource.package}&rsquo;)&rdquo;
  execute &ldquo;Remove R Package&rdquo; do</p>

<pre><code>command "echo \"#{r_package_remove}\" | R --no-save --no-restore -q"
only_if r_package_is_installed(new_resource.package)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<h1>The following helper functions construct strings that can be run as</h1>

<h1>Bash commands. For example, as the input of not_if or only_if</h1>

<h1>statements</h1>

<p>def r_package_is_installed(package_name)
  r_code = &ldquo;if (any(installed.packages()[,1] == &lsquo;#{package_name}&rsquo;)) { quit(&lsquo;no&rsquo;, 0, FALSE) }; quit(&lsquo;no&rsquo;, 1, FALSE)&rdquo;
  &ldquo;echo \&rdquo;#{r_code}\&ldquo; | R &mdash;no-save &mdash;no-restore -q&rdquo;
end</p>

<p>def r_package_install(package_name)
  r_code = &ldquo;install.packages(&lsquo;#{package_name}&rsquo;)&rdquo;
  &ldquo;echo \&rdquo;#{r_code}\&ldquo; | R &mdash;no-save &mdash;no-restore -q&rdquo;
end
```</p>

<p>It supports three actions: <code>:install</code>, <code>:upgrade</code>, and
<code>:remove</code>; however, it is not very feature-rich.  A few features I
would like to add include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ability to specify the CRAN mirror or repository.</li>
<li>The ability to install local packages</li>
<li>The ability to install packages on a per-user basis.</li>
</ul>


<p>Despite these shortcomings, the current provider works well enough for
my purposes and is a good example of Chef&rsquo;s high-level of
&lsquo;Whip-It-Up-itude.&rsquo;  Within a few minutes, I was able to go from some
quick-and-dirty R code to a Chef provider that I can iteratively
improve as my needs become more complex.  While I did not include it
in the repository linked above, I was able to create a small <code>R::snow</code>
recipe that does little more than use this provider:</p>

<p>``` ruby
R_package &ldquo;snow&rdquo;</p>

<p>case node[&lsquo;R&rsquo;][&lsquo;snow&rsquo;][&lsquo;cluster_type&rsquo;]
when &lsquo;mpi&rsquo;
  include_recipe &lsquo;mpi&rsquo;
  R_package &lsquo;Rmpi&rsquo;
end
```</p>

<h1>MPI Cookbook</h1>

<p>The R package &lsquo;snow&rsquo; can use various backends to communicate with
computation nodes.  The default method for most commands is &ldquo;Message
Passing Interface&rdquo; (MPI).  MPI is also generally useful outside of R
as you can easily use MPI utilities such as mpirun to execute a
command on multiple computation nodes and use MPI&rsquo;s C libraries to
write programs designed for parallel computation.</p>

<p>MPI has multiple implementation.  I&rsquo;ve written an MPI cookbook that
can install <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/">openmpi</a> on Ubuntu.  It can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/stevendanna/cookbook-mpi">https://github.com/stevendanna/cookbook-mpi</a></p>

<p>This cookbook does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installs openmpi on Ubuntu</li>
<li>Constructs a list of computation nodes within your environment using
search and then renders a default hostfile that is used by MPI
commands such as mpirun.</li>
<li>Sets basic configuration options that I have found useful.</li>
</ul>


<p>While MPI does not natively contain the concepts of master and slaves
(every MPI node can talk to any other MPI node), I found it useful to
include the concept of a node&rsquo;s &ldquo;MPI role.&rdquo;  I use this role to
populate the default hostfile, since there are often cases where you
might want MPI installed on a machine within your environment but
would not want that machine being used for computation.</p>

<h1>Putting it all Together</h1>

<p>I put this all together using two roles: snow_master and snow_slave</p>

<p>``` ruby roles/snow_master.json
{</p>

<pre><code>"name" : "snow_master",
"json_class" : "Chef::Role",
"chef_type" : "role",
"run_list" : [ "recipe[R]", "recipe[R::snow]", "recipe[mpi]", "recipe[ssh_known_hosts]" ],
"default_attributes" : {
    "mpi" : {
        "role": "master"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>``` ruby roles/snow_slave.json
{</p>

<pre><code>"name" : "snow_slave",
"json_class" : "Chef::Role",
"chef_type" : "role",
"run_list" : [ "recipe[R]", "recipe[R::snow]", "recipe[mpi]", "recipe[ssh_known_hosts]" ]
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>By applying the snow_slave role to all of the nodes I wanted within
my computation cluster and the snow_master role to the machine I will
use to launch jobs in my cluster, I can quickly bring up a new cluster
of machines suitable for doing parallel computation in R using snow.</p>

<p>The ssh_known_hosts recipe is directly from the Opscode community
site and helps make ssh connections between the nodes a bit smoother.</p>

<h1>Twelve Days of Chistmas</h1>

<p>As an example of how easy it is to do simple parallel computation
using snow, consider the following Chistmas-themed R function.</p>

<p>``` r
twelve_days_of_christmas &lt;&ndash; function (n) {
  if (!any(1:12 == n)) stop(&ldquo;Not a day of Chirstmas!&rdquo;)
  LYRICS &lt;&ndash; c(&ldquo;a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;,</p>

<pre><code>          "Two Turtle Doves",
          "Three French Hens",
          "Four Colly Birds",
          "Five Golden Rings",
          "Six Geese-a-Laying",
          "Seven Swans-a-Swimming",
          "Eight Maids-a-Milking",
          "Nine Ladies Dancing",
          "Ten Lords-a-Leaping",
          "Eleven Pipers Piping",
          "Twleve Drummers Drumming")
</code></pre>

<p>  append = c(&ldquo;st&rdquo;, &ldquo;nd&rdquo;, &ldquo;rd&rdquo;, rep(&ldquo;th&rdquo;,9))
  if (n > 1) LYRICS[1] = paste(&ldquo;and&rdquo;, LYRICS[1])
  paste(&ldquo;On the&rdquo;,</p>

<pre><code>    paste(n, append[n], sep=""),
    "day of Christmas, my true love gave to me",
    paste(LYRICS[n:1], collapse=", "))
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Assuming chef-client has been run on all of our nodes, we can simply
log into our &lsquo;snow master&rsquo;, boot up R, and run the following code:</p>

<p>``` r</p>

<blockquote><p>library(&lsquo;snow&rsquo;)
source(&lsquo;twelve_days.r&rsquo;)
cl &lt;&ndash; makeCluster(2)
clusterApply(cl, 1:12, twelve_days_of_christmas)
[[1]]
[1] &ldquo;On the 1st day of Christmas, my true love gave to me a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>[[2]]
[1] &ldquo;On the 2nd day of Christmas, my true love gave to me Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[[3]]
[1] &ldquo;On the 3rd day of Christmas, my true love gave to me Three French Hens, Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[[4]]
[1] &ldquo;On the 4th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me Four Colly Birds, Three French Hens, Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[[5]]
[1] &ldquo;On the 5th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me Five Goldedn Rings, Four Colly Birds, Three French Hens, Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[[6]]
[1] &ldquo;On the 6th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me Six Geese-a-Laying, Five Goldedn Rings, Four Colly Birds, Three French Hens, Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[[7]]
[1] &ldquo;On the 7th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me Seven Swans-a-Swimming, Six Geese-a-Laying, Five Goldedn Rings, Four Colly Birds, Three French Hens, Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[[8]]
[1] &ldquo;On the 8th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me Eight Maids-a-Milking, Seven Swans-a-Swimming, Six Geese-a-Laying, Five Goldedn Rings, Four Colly Birds, Three French Hens, Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[[9]]
[1] &ldquo;On the 9th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me Nine Ladies Dancing, Eight Maids-a-Milking, Seven Swans-a-Swimming, Six Geese-a-Laying, Five Goldedn Rings, Four Colly Birds, Three French Hens, Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[[10]]
[1] &ldquo;On the 10th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me Ten Lords-a-Leaping, Nine Ladies Dancing, Eight Maids-a-Milking, Seven Swans-a-Swimming, Six Geese-a-Laying, Five Goldedn Rings, Four Colly Birds, Three French Hens, Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[[11]]
[1] &ldquo;On the 11th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me Eleven Pipers Piping, Ten Lords-a-Leaping, Nine Ladies Dancing, Eight Maids-a-Milking, Seven Swans-a-Swimming, Six Geese-a-Laying, Five Goldedn Rings, Four Colly Birds, Three French Hens, Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[[12]]
[1] &ldquo;On the 12th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me Twleve Drummers Drumming, Eleven Pipers Piping, Ten Lords-a-Leaping, Nine Ladies Dancing, Eight Maids-a-Milking, Seven Swans-a-Swimming, Six Geese-a-Laying, Five Goldedn Rings, Four Colly Birds, Three French Hens, Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.&rdquo;
```</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Overall this was a fun project to do over break.  It took a handful of
hours to complete, most of which was dedicated to a few problems not
discussed in this post:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making hostnames resolvable and other network oddities within my
Vagrant test environment.</li>
<li>Deciding which implementation of MPI to use.</li>
</ul>


<p>I personally would like to see further work done around using Chef to
manage large R environments. Some work I hope to do in the not to
distant future includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expand the R cookbook to better support OS X.</li>
<li>Add support to detect the latest version when doing a source install.</li>
<li>Expand the R package provider to include more of the features available
when installing package from within R.</li>
<li>Write an R Ohai plugin that would collect information about:

<ul>
<li>R version and capabilities</li>
<li>R packages installed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
