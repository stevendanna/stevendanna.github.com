Introductory blog posts are awkward.  Come back in the future to read less
awkward blog posts.  Possible topics for such blog posts
include:

* Linux and Unix systems administration
* Technical writing
* Programming projects I'm working on in my free time
* Free software
* Chef and Opscode
* Running
* Cooking

I recently finished school and am beginning a career in technology.
Most of my formal education is in Mathematics and Economics; I hope to
chronicle parts of my informal, on-the-job education here.

I live in Seattle, WA with my wife Theresa.  I enjoy running, cooking,
and movies and may occasionally write posts on these topics as well.

I work for [Opscode, Inc](www.opscode.com).  The opinions expressed
here are my own and do not reflect those of my employer.  Or, in other
words,
